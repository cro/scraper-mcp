"""MCP scraping tools and business logic.

This module provides the core scraping functionality exposed as MCP tools:
- scrape_url: HTML to Markdown conversion (default)
- scrape_url_html: Raw HTML content retrieval
- scrape_url_text: Plain text extraction
- scrape_extract_links: Link discovery and extraction

The tools module follows a router -> service pattern:
- router.py: MCP tool definitions and registration
- service.py: Business logic for scraping, parsing, and batch operations

All tools support:
- Batch operations (multiple URLs)
- Configurable timeouts and retries
- CSS selector filtering
- Concurrent execution with semaphore control
- Error handling with graceful degradation
