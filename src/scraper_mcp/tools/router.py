    Tool Registration Pattern:
    -------------------------
    This function uses FastMCP's decorator pattern to register async functions
    as MCP tools. The pattern `mcp.tool()(function)` is equivalent to:

        @mcp.tool()
        async def function(...):
            ...

    By using the functional approach, we can:
    1. Define tools in this module with proper type hints
    2. Keep business logic separate in service.py
    3. Register all tools in one place for clarity
    4. Make tools importable for testing

    The MCP framework automatically:
    - Extracts function signatures for tool schemas
    - Generates OpenAPI-compatible documentation from docstrings
    - Handles JSON serialization of Pydantic models
    - Routes incoming tool calls to the registered functions

    Args:
        mcp: FastMCP server instance to register tools on

    Example:
        >>> from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
        >>> mcp = FastMCP("Scraper")
        >>> register_scraping_tools(mcp)
        >>> # Tools are now available via MCP protocol
    """
